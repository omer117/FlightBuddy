# FlightBuddy
## _Connecting people around the world_

Let's say you live in Israel, And your friend John lives in the UK.
You try to find a nice place in the middle, 
And _FlightBuddy_ is here to help you both.

 
_FlightBuddy_ is a smart flight search website, that lets you insert your selected airports, The output is 5 airports you can choose from to meet in the middle, and we are thinking about your time of course!
choose the airport you want and choose the flights for both of you, this is that easy.  





## Why did you choose to build FlightBuddy?
I developed the function of finding the place in the middle because in 2021 I had to break my head about where to meet my good friend, I lived in Israel and she was in Thailand and it was complicated, but in the end, we agreed on Dubai!
But apparently, the process was easier with FlightBuddy
